# NCList
Contains a C++ implementation of [Nested Containment Lists](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/23/11/1386/199545) and a demo comparison with an interval tree implementation

## Installation
This depends on GBase, from Geo Pertea's [GClib](https://github.com/gpertea/gclib), so grab the necessary files separately
