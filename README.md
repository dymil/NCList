# NCList
Contains a C++ implementation of [Nested Containment Lists](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btl647) and a demo comparison with an interval tree implementation

## Installation
The mapped_nc comparison code depends on GBase, from Geo Pertea's [GClib](https://github.com/gpertea/gclib), so grab the necessary files separately; the actual NCList implementation does not require modern C++ though.
